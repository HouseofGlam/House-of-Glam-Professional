HOUSE OF GLAM is a social enterprise that commercializes sustainable apparel retail by integrating circular-economy operations (collection, sorting, repair, upcycling, resale), local micro-franchising (community resellers run branded stalls/mini-shops), and social programs (skills training, employment, and donations for children’s homes). The enterprise generates revenue through retail sales, repair/upcycle services, micro-franchise fees and recurring subscriptions while delivering measurable environmental and social impact: diverting textiles from landfill, creating dignified jobs for women and youth, improving household access to affordable clothing, and strengthening local value chains.
